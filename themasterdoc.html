<h2>My Manifesto</h2>
  <p>Throughout my short time on this earth, I feel I have collected the knowlege I need to help myself focus and set my sights on a point in the future. My key is to minimize my distractions as much as possible so I am able to get the maximum ammount of work done so I can achieve my goals. This means decluttering my life to essentials. Not buying extemporaneous items. Getting rid of items that do not bring me joy. I will achive this. I will achive this soon. Everything I do will refelct a more minimalist sensibility. There are certain things I cannot change, but I will change my life in other small ways adding up to the big change.</p>
