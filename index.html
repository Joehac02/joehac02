  <p>Launenforschung pronounced "Lau-nen-vor-shung" is the german word for "whim research". This is what I hope this collection will be. A collection of research, projects, essays and lists I work on.</p>

  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p> This site is designed as a digital notebook. One that holds almost all the knowledge I collect and produce. This area is designed to also provide me with a go to area to go to when I need to clarify who I am. My ideals, my ideas, my dreams, what keeps me going. It will all be stored here. This is for me to decide who I am and get working towards a better me. This webpage is very much inspired by other online personal wikis such as Devine Lu Linvega's Nataniev , Josh Avanier's Athenaeum  and Mika Naylor's Hr«Ωw.These sites serve as constant inspiration to create and work smarter.</p>
